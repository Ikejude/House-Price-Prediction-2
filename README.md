# House-Price-Prediction-2-Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices. The model aims to estimate the sale prices of houses based on various features and characteristics.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset comprised of historical house sale records. The dataset includes information such as the house's location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and other relevant features. These features serve as input variables for the house price prediction model.

## Model Description
The house price prediction model is built using machine learning techniques, specifically regression algorithms, to estimate the price of a house. The model takes into account various factors that can influence house prices and uses historical data to learn patterns and relationships between the features and the corresponding sale prices.

Key steps of the model development process include:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the input data to ensure consistency and suitability for regression. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.

* Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction of house prices. This can be done using statistical techniques or domain knowledge.

* Model Training: Employing regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests to train the model on the preprocessed dataset. The model learns the relationship between the features and the house prices during this training phase.

* Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared (R^2) score. These metrics help measure the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.

* Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. Given the features of a house, the model estimates the corresponding sale price.

## Usage
To use the house price prediction model, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

* Prepare your input data in a format that matches the required input of the model. Ensure the features are preprocessed and encoded as necessary.

* Load the trained model into your Python environment.

* Call the model's prediction function, providing the input data as arguments. The function will return the estimated price of the house.

## Evaluation
Evaluation of the house price prediction model can be performed using various metrics, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, visualizations such as scatter plots comparing the actual prices and predicted prices can help assess the model's performance visually.
